# Day 4: Weather Dashboard - Feature Enhancements

## Project Overview
Building on the Day 3 project, this session focuses on adding several new features to the Weather Dashboard, all within the limits of the free OpenWeatherMap API.

## New Features
- **Geolocation**: Automatically fetch weather for the user's current location on page load.
- **Weather Icons**: Display dynamic icons that change based on the weather conditions.
- **Enhanced Data**: Show "feels like" temperature and wind speed.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Provide a daily forecast for the next five days.

## How to Run
1.  Copy the files from the `Day3` directory into this `Day4` directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
3.  Allow location access when prompted to see your local weather automatically.

## API Reference
- [OpenWeatherMap One Call API 1.0 (for forecast)](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
